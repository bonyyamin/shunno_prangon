# SECURITY

## Security Policy

We take the security of our software seriously. This document outlines security practices, vulnerability reporting guidelines, and best practices for users and contributors.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Private Disclosure Process

We prefer to receive vulnerability reports through private channels to allow for coordinated disclosure:

**Email:** bonyyamin1997@gmail.com or openiwork@gmail.com

**Preferred Format:**
- Subject: "Security Vulnerability Report: [Brief Description]"
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fixes (if any)
- Your contact information

### Response Time

We strive to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide initial assessment within 5 business days
- Keep you informed of our progress
- Coordinate public disclosure timing

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies using `flutter pub upgrade`
   - Review pubspec.yaml for known vulnerabilities
   - Use `flutter pub outdated` to identify outdated packages

2. **Code Security**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

3. **Secure Storage**
   - Use encrypted storage for sensitive data
   - Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text
   - Use platform-specific secure storage solutions

### For Users

1. **Application Security**
   - Keep the application updated to the latest version
   - Only install from official app stores
   - Review app permissions carefully

2. **Data Protection**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication when available
   - Be cautious with personal information sharing

## Known Security Considerations

### Flutter-Specific
- **Web Security**: Implement proper CORS policies for web applications
- **Native Integration**: Validate all data passed between Dart and native code
- **Platform Channels**: Sanitize all data received through platform channels

### Common Vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries with sqflite or other database packages
- **XSS**: Sanitize all user-generated content in web applications
- **CSRF**: Implement proper token-based protection for web endpoints

## Security Updates

We regularly:
- Monitor security advisories for Flutter and Dart
- Update dependencies with security patches
- Conduct security reviews of new features
- Perform periodic security audits

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:
- Credit security researchers who report vulnerabilities
- Work with reporters to coordinate public disclosure
- Provide reasonable time for users to update before public disclosure
